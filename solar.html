        <h4>The Solar System: A Journey Through Our Cosmic Neighborhood</h4>
        <br>
    <p>
        The solar system is a captivating expanse of space that includes our home planet, Earth, and a host of celestial bodies bound together by the gravitational pull of the Sun. It stretches across vast distances and contains a variety of objects, each with unique characteristics and mysteries. Understanding the solar system provides insights into the formation of the universe, the dynamics of celestial motion, and the potential for life beyond Earth.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>The Sun: The Heart of the Solar System</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b>At the center of the solar system lies the Sun</b>, a massive, glowing ball of plasma that provides energy and light to all its orbiting bodies. The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the solar system's total mass and generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core. This process releases immense amounts of heat and light, making the Sun the primary source of energy for Earth and other planets. Without the Sun, life as we know it would not exist.
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol>The Sun’s structure consists of several layers:
        <li>Core: The innermost layer, where nuclear fusion occurs.</li>
        <li>Radiative Zone: Energy moves outward in the form of electromagnetic radiation.</li>
        <li>Convective Zone: Currents of hot plasma rise and fall, transferring energy to the surface.</li>
        <li>Photosphere: The visible surface of the Sun.</li>
        <li>Corona: The outermost layer, visible during solar eclipses as a halo of light.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h4>Moons: Natural Satellites</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Many planets have moons, which are natural satellites that orbit their parent planets. Earth’s Moon stabilizes its axial tilt and influences tides. Other moons, such as Jupiter’s Ganymede and Saturn’s Titan, are larger than Mercury. Moons like Europa and Enceladus have subsurface oceans that may harbor life.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>The Formation of the Solar System</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The solar system formed about <b>4.6 billion years ago </b>from a rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. Gravity caused the nebula to collapse, forming the Sun at its center. The remaining material flattened into a disk, where dust and gas coalesced to form planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.

    The inner, hotter region of the disk gave rise to terrestrial planets, while the cooler outer regions allowed gas giants and icy bodies to form. Understanding this process helps scientists study other star systems and the possibility of planets around them.</p>
